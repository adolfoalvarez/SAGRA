Description: This package implements the SAGRA (Splitting And Group Recombining Algorithm),
    a Cluster Analysis algorithm described in Alvarez and PeÃ±a (2014).
    SAGRA is based on a "divide and conquest": First it divides the data in
    small homogeneous groups and later recombine them using Bayes Factors.
